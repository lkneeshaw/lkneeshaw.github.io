                <h1>Background</h1>
                <p>I am a student at Eastern Washington University pursuing a degree in Visual Communication Design and a certificate in User Experience Design. My goal is to become a web designer.</p>
                <p>I was born and raised in Spokane, Washington. My dad is a graphic designer, so design has always been a subtle but constant presence in my life, a sort of backdrop. Web design, however, was a brand new world. Quite absurdly, my first experience with coding was on Myspace, fiddling around with my profile page. If anyone had told me I would be doing the some sort of stuff in college—albeit a little more complicated—I would have laughed.</p>
                <p>In addition to design, I am a self-taught artist who works in both traditional and digital mediums. I also write. I tend to tear through books in sprints and feel bereft when I finish them. I hope to someday publish one of my own. </p>
